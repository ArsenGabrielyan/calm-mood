## Testing
- Make sure all pages load correctly in **light and dark mode**.
- Check responsiveness (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Verify that translations display properly when switching languages.
- Try the breathing exercise and sound mixer to confirm timing, animations, and volume controls.

## Translating Calm Mood to another language
> [!NOTE]
> - All translations live in the `i18n/` folder.
> - Each language has its own JSON file. Example: `i18n/hy.json` for Armenian.
> - Please keep placeholders (`%s`, `%d`) intact when translating.
> - If unsure about terminology, open a draft PR ‚Äî maintainers will help review.

1. Make sure to download the base language file from one of these languages
   - [Armenian][armenian-base-json]
   - [English][english-base-json]
2. Translate the content of all keys with your preferred tool
3. Save your edited JSON file as `[lang-code].json` (Examples: `fr.json`, `el.json`, `fa.json`, etc.)
4. Do the following for testing the translation
   - Add the `[lang-code].json` into `i18n/` folder
   - Add the following object into `src/i18n/config.ts`:
     ```ts
      export const languages = [
         // All Existing Languages +
         {code: "<lang-code> (example: el)", countryCode: "<country-code> (example: gr)", label: "<native-name> (example: ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ¨)"}
         // ^ This will be your contribution :-)
      ] as const satisfies readonly ILanguage[];
      ```
5. Once Ready, open the Pull Request, so I'll include them in the app after review

## Feedback & Feature Requests
We love new ideas! If you have a suggestion:
1. Check the [issues][issues-url] to see if it already exists.
2. If not, open a [new feature request][new-feature-request-url].
3. Clearly explain the motivation (why it helps users) and, if possible, how it could be implemented (the Feature request template says it all ‚ò∫Ô∏è).

- Be respectful and kind ‚Äî Calm Mood is about **peace and optimism**, not conflict and pessimism.
- Provide constructive feedback (focus on ideas, not people).
- Keep discussions on-topic and inclusive.
